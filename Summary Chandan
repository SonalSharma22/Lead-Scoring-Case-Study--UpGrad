Summary : 

Here within my team has completed an analysis for X Education and our objective was to figure out which attributes leads to get more industry professionals to join their courses. The data provided was historical which gave us a lot of information about the customers, ther behaviour and conversions.

Below mentioned are the steps used to perform the activities 
1. Cleaning data:
	The most important step of data cleaning is figuring out NULL values and imputing them, the same has been applied on the provided data set.
	The next step was to understand the business description behind each column and drop if any unnecessary or key columns
	Categorical data with high level of distint values were grouped together
	
2. EDA:
	An Exploratory Data Analysis was done to check the story behind each attribute and how they react to target field(Converted). 
	It was found that a lot of attributes in the categorical variables were irrelevant. 
	The numeric values had outliers which were handled.
	After validating Bar plots for all the categorical values: 

		1. Lead Source : google and Google can be merged 
		2. Country can be segregated as India, NA and US and Others, there are many similar fields 
		3. Field with one Unique value can be dropped as no one is interested for these offers and this migh make the model skewed 
		
	Observations: From the above EDA,
		Most converted leads are originated from Lead add and landing page submission
		Most Conversion has happened from Google , Direct traffic and reference
		Leads dont want calls or mails
		Most converted are unemployed and looking for better career prospects
		Most leads didn't see any adds in search , magazine , Education forum, news paper or digital forum
		
3. One Hot encoding and Scaling:
	The dummy variables were created and NA were removed
	For numeric values we used the MinMaxScaler.

4. Train-Test split of Data:
	The split was done at 70% and 30% for train and test data respectively.
	
5. Model Building:
	Firstly, RFE was done to attain the top 15 relevant variables. 
	Secondly VIF values and p-value were used to remove few more variable which were creating influence (The variables with VIF < 5 and p-value < 0.05 were kept).
	
6. Model Evaluation:
	Confusion matrix and ROC was created for train Data, then calculation were made to find out the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity 
	which came to be around
	Train:
    accuracy:0.8620902906617193
    sensitivity:0.7827476038338658
    specificity:0.9122098890010091

Test:
    accuracy:0.8647186147186147
    sensitivity:0.7956480605487228
    specificity:0.9072886297376094

7. Prediction:
Prediction was done on the test data frame and with an optimum cut off as 0.6 with
accuracy ~86%.

From EDA the attributes which is of great interest 
1. Most converted leads are originated from Lead add and landing page submission
2. Most Conversion has happened from Google , Direct traffic and reference
3. Leads dont want calls or mails
4. Most converted are unemployed and looking for better career prospects
5. Most leads didn't see any adds in search , magazine , Education forum, news paper or digital forum

It was found that the attributes that mattered the most in prediction are as follows 
1. Total Time Spent on Website 
2. Last Notable Activity Modified
3. Last Activity_SMS Sent
4. Interested in other courses
5. Closed by Horizzon
6. Ringing
7. Already a student
8. Lost to EINS	
9. Welingak Website	
10. Not doing further education	
11. Interested in full time MBA	


Keeping these in mind the X Education can flourish as they have a very high chance to get
almost all the potential buyers to change their mind and buy their courses.
